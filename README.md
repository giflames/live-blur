# Live Face Blurring

This repository contains Python code for live face blurring through webcam feed made in Asimov Python Course classes. The script utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and blur faces in real-time captured by your webcam. This project is helpful for maintaining privacy in video streams or images by anonymizing faces on-the-fly.

### Features:
Real-time face detection and blurring.
Simple and efficient implementation using OpenCV and Haar cascades.
Adjustable blur intensity for customized privacy levels.
Lightweight and easy to integrate into existing projects.


### Requirements:
Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
NumPy (numpy)


### Usage:
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/live-blur.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install
3. Run the script: python live_blur.py
